Submission Details

In order to run the static bug finder, simply run `mvn clean verify`. This command will allow you to
see all audit checks relating to Checkstyle violations, all tests that have run, and the success
status of the build. `PMD` is added as a dependency within the `pom.xml` file. This assignment was
completed on Mac OS using IntelliJ. Additional dependencies that were added are `mockito-core`,
`mockito-junit-jupiter`, `junit-jupiter-engine`, and, for reporting,
`maven-project-info-reports-plugin`. See the `pom.xml` for specific versions.
